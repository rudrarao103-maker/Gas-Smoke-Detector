Steps to Upload the Code:
To upload this code to an ESP32 board, you'll need the Arduino IDE. If you don't have it, download and install it from the official Arduino website.

1. Install Arduino IDE and ESP32 Support:
* Open Arduino IDE.
* Go to File > Preferences.
* In the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field, add: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json.
* Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager, search for "ESP32", and install the "ESP32 by Espressif Systems" package.


2.  Prepare Your Hardware:
* Connect your ESP32 board to your computer via USB.
* Wire your components:
* MQ2 sensor: Analog output to ESP32 pin 34 (GND and VCC to appropriate power).
* Buzzer: Positive to ESP32 pin 12, negative to GND (add a resistor if needed).
* Ensure your WiFi network is available and you have your Telegram bot token and chat ID ready.


3.  Set Up the Code:
* Open a new sketch in Arduino IDE.
* Copy-paste the provided code into the sketch.
* Replace the placeholders:
* ssid and password with your WiFi details.
* botToken with your Telegram bot token (get from BotFather).
* chatID with your Telegram chat ID (e.g., send a message to your bot and check the API response or use a tool like @userinfobot).
* Save the sketch (e.g., as "GasDetector.ino").


4.  Select Board and Port:
* Go to Tools > Board and select your ESP32 model (e.g., "ESP32 Dev Module" if unsure).
* Go to Tools > Port and select the COM port your ESP32 is connected to (it should appear as something like "COM3" or "/dev/ttyUSB0").


5.  Upload the Code:
* Click the Upload button (right arrow icon) in Arduino IDE.
* The IDE will compile and upload the code. Watch the status bar for progress.
* If you see errors (e.g., about libraries), ensure ESP32 support is installed and try restarting the IDE.


6.  Test and Monitor:
* Open the Serial Monitor (Tools > Serial Monitor) and set baud rate to 115200.
* Power on the ESP32. It will calibrate for 30 seconds (watch Serial output), then start monitoring.
* Expose the MQ2 sensor to gas (safely, e.g., near a lighter) to test alerts. Check your Telegram chat for messages and listen for the buzzer.
* If issues arise (e.g., WiFi connection fails), double-check credentials and network.
